# quick-notes
- This portal does not require any registration and is open to use for students.  
- The portal is hosted on a heroku-free-dynamo which provides a limit on the time for which you can access the portal within a month.  
- Your solutions are not stored on server and therefore it's your responsibility to maintain a list of problems you have done and the problems which are yet to be done!  
- On a successful submission you will get a prompt where you can choose whether or not you wish to save your solution to your browser's local storage.  
- You can grab the list of solutions saved on your browser's local-storage using [https://course-problem-deck.herokuapp.com/localStorage](https://course-problem-deck.herokuapp.com/localStorage)  
- You can grab all the problems for `The Complete C Course` via [https://course-problem-deck.herokuapp.com/course/the-complete-c-course/](https://course-problem-deck.herokuapp.com/course/the-complete-c-course/)  
- If your submission ends up with an error saying `command failed ....`, you can try to re-submitting your solution and see if that works for you! This is a server-side bug!
